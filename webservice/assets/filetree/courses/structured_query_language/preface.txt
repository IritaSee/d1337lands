So I asked this to chatGPT and it says:

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language used to communicate with databases. 
It is the standard language for managing and manipulating data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). 
Learning SQL allows you to effectively manage and manipulate data in a database, which is a crucial skill for many roles in the tech industry, 
such as data analysts, data scientists, and database administrators.

By learning SQL, you can:

-Write queries to retrieve and manipulate data from a database
-Create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables and views
-Control access to data and secure the database
-Create database reports and analyses
-Overall, learning SQL is important because it is a widely-used and powerful tool for managing and analyzing data, 
and is an essential skill for anyone working with data in the tech industry.

quite obvious now right? We cannot be a good data player without (at least, bearable) skill of SQL. As we know, the data game has got its hype now.
Some kind of false and too good to be true ads of data scientist job also has been uptrending. Then what are you waiting for??
